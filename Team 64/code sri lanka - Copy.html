<h1>Jaffna::</h1>
<center>
<p>
  <i>
    Traveling to Jaffna will provide one with an altogether different experience than the rest of the country. <br>Just by stepping into the city, one will feel like entering into a completely new world.<br> The North of Sri Lanka is totally the world apart from rest of the country due to its closeness with Southern part of India. <br>This part of the country has been repeatedly invaded and settled by Tamil Indians and hence it carries <br>the vast cultural difference. The town was the center of the majority of civil wars and battles.<br> But the days of doom and isolation have past gone for the town as it is now emerging as one of the most visited tourist destinations of Sri Lanka.<br>

The first and foremost attraction for the traveler in the fascinating town of Jaffna will definitely be the mixture<br> of colonial charm and vibrant Sri Lankan Tamil culture. The town smells like India in<br> terms of food, feels like India in terms of people and sounds like India as one can easily listen to the sound of Indian pop<br> music inside the cafe or on the roads. But the town has a unique identity of its own and is controlled ><br>by mixed communities namely Muslim, Portuguese, Dutch, British and Sinhalese. The churches can<br> be seen rubbing shoulders with temples and streets are lined up with beautiful Dutch and British homes. Yet, on the other hand, Jaffna is green and<br> leafy and has attractive palm-shaded colonial-era suburbs and beautiful temples and churches. <br>The peninsula and surrounding islands offer a string of remote temples, Hindu and Buddhist alike, beaches and more offbeat tourist attractions.<br> The popular sightseeing destinations in Jaffna include Jaffna Fort, Nallur Temple, Selva Sannithi Temple, <br>Nagapoosani Temple, Nagadeepa Temple and Sri Naga Vihara Temple. One can also visit Jaffna during Nallur <br>Kovil Thaer Thiruvizha (Chariot Festival), Harvest Festival or Tamil New Year to explore the<br> spirit of the city at its rawest best.
